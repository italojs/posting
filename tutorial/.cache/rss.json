    "contentSnippet": "Hey HN! We're Vaibhav and Marcello, founders of Plexe (https://www.plexe.ai). We create production-ready ML models from natural language descriptions. Tell Plexe what ML problem you want to solve, point it at your data, and it handles the entire pipeline from feature engineering to deployment.\nHere’s a walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbOfx6UPuX4.\nML teams waste too much time on generic heavy lifting. Every project follows the same pattern: 20% understanding objectives, 60% wrangling data and engineering features, 20% experimenting with models. Most of this is formulaic but burns months of engineering time. Throwing LLMs at it isn't the answer as that just trades engineering time for compute costs and worse accuracy. Plexe automates this repetitive 80%, so your team can work faster on what actually has value.\nYou describe your problem in plain English (\"fraud detection model for transactions\" or \"product embedding model for search\"), connect your data (Postgres, Snowflake, S3, direct upload, etc), and then Plexe:\n- Analyzes data and engineers features automatically\n- Runs experiments across multiple architectures (logistic regression to neural nets)\n- Generates comprehensive evaluation reports with error analysis, robustness testing, and prioritized recommendations to provide actionable guidance\n- Deploys the best model with monitoring and automatic retraining\nWe did a Show HN for our open-source library five months ago (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43906346). Since then, we've launched our commercial platform with interactive refinement, production-grade model evaluations, retraining pipeline, data connectors, analytics dashboards, and deployment for online and batch inference.\nWe use a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle different pipeline stages. Each agent focuses on its domain: data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, deployment, and so on. The platform tracks all experiments and generates exportable Python code.\nOur open-source core (https://github.com/plexe-ai/plexe, Apache 2.0) remains free for local development. For the paid product, our pricing is usage-based, with a minimum top up of $10. Enterprises can self-host the entire platform. You can sign up on https://console.plexe.ai. Use promo code `LAUNCHDAY20` to get $20 to try out the platform.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts on the problem and feedback on the platform!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45813310\nPoints: 28\n# Comments: 6",

    "contentSnippet": "Just saw the CEO of Substack celebrating traffic from X/Twitter shooting up thinking they stopped suppressing tweets with links[0]. Actually, this traffic is because now any time you open a tweet with a link, the in-app webview loads in the background, and displays when you press the link.\nI run an ecom store that gets a lot of its customers from Twitter. I was also shocked to see my traffic double or triple overnight and thought the algorithm had blessed me and my business. Soon realized what was actually happening. Thought other traffic-monitors might appreciate this explanation.\nMeanwhile Nikita Bier is pretending they never suppressed tweets with links to begin with, offering the alternative explanation: \"a common complaint is that posts with links tend to get lower reach. This is because the web browser covers the post and people forget to Like or Reply. So X doesn't get a clear signal whether the content is any good\"[1]. A bit of a rewriting of history since Elon and his mom both tweeted about how it wasn't fair to use his platform to promote other links/platforms, even banning people who shared profiles of other social networks (including Paul Graham for a period). They suppressed all links shortly after.\n[0] https://x.com/cjgbest/status/1985464687350485092\n[1] https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1979994223224209709\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45807775\nPoints: 405\n# Comments: 364",
